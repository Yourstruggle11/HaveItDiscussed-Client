# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and value the efforts of security researchers to improve the security of our project. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in this repository, please follow the responsible disclosure guidelines below.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue. Instead, report the vulnerability responsibly by sending an email to [souviksen093@gmail.com](mailto:souviksen093@gmail.com). 

Please include the following details in your email:

- Your name and affiliation (if any).
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any relevant information about the environment in which the vulnerability was discovered (e.g., versions of software, operating system, etc.).

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and aim to provide a timeline for fixing the vulnerability promptly. We will keep you updated on the progress of the fix and attribute the discovery if you wish.

### Scope

The security policy applies only to the code in this repository. If you find a vulnerability in other parts of our project or related projects, please report them separately following their respective security policies.

## Responsible Disclosure

We request that you do not disclose the vulnerability you found publicly until we have had sufficient time to address the issue and release any necessary patches. Once the issue has been resolved, we will provide you with the green light to disclose the details.
