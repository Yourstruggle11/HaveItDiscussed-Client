# ***Attention***
###  Hello solver, if you are reading this meaning you are one of the few who got into the early release of HaveItDiscussed.

### I am writing this so that you can understand this website more clearly if there is any doubt.

### It's an online forum, a great example of an online forum is StackOverflow I think you've heard the name. So you can ask qstn or if any kind of doubt just ask the community I believe someone will answer your question. And if you see someone asking a question, you already know the answer please answer them.


# Note: HaveItDiscussed is still in beta so if you find any bugs feel free to open a PR.
